# TiDB Operator v1.1.0-rc.1 Release Notes

# TiDB Operator v1.1.0-beta.1 Release Notes

This is a pre-release of `v1.1.0`, which focuses on the usability, extensibility and security of TiDB Operator. While we encourage usage in non-critical environments, it is **NOT** recommended to use this version in critical environments.

## Changes since v1.0.0

### Action Required

- ACTION REQUIRED: Add the `timezone` support for [all charts](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/tree/master/charts) ([#1122](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1122), [@weekface](https://github.com/weekface)).
  
  For the `tidb-cluster` chart, we already have the `timezone` option (`UTC` by default). If the user does not change it to a different value (for example: `Aisa/Shanghai`), all Pods will not be recreated.
  If the user changes it to another value (for example: `Aisa/Shanghai`), all the related Pods (add a `TZ` env) will be recreated (rolling update).
  
  Regarding other charts, we don't have a `timezone` option in their `values.yaml`. We add the `timezone` option in this PR. No matter whether the user uses the old `values.yaml` or the new `values.yaml`, all the related Pods (add a `TZ` env) will not be recreated (rolling update).
  
  The related Pods include `pump`, `drainer`, `dicovery`, `monitor`, `scheduled backup`, `tidb-initializer`, and `tikv-importer`.
  
  All images' time zone maintained by `tidb-operator` is `UTC`. If you use your own images, you need to make sure that the time zone inside your images is `UTC`. 

### Other Notable Changes

- Support backup to S3 with [Backup & Restore (BR)](https://github.com/pingcap/br) ([#1280](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1280), [@DanielZhangQD](https://github.com/DanielZhangQD))
