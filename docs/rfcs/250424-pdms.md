## Release Signoff Checklist

Items marked with (R) are required *prior to targeting to a release*.

- [x] (R) This design doc has been discussed and approved
- [ ] (R) Test plan is in place
  - [ ] (R) e2e tests in kind
- [ ] (R) Graduation criteria is in place if required
- [ ] (R) User-facing documentation has been created in [pingcap/docs-tidb-operator]

## Summary

Currently, PD support [ms](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5766) mode. It should be supported by tidb operator.

## Motivation

### Goals

- Deploy PD in ms mode
- Update PD from normal mode to ms mode
- Update PD from ms mode back to normal mode

### Non-Goals

- Reuse common fields between PD components.

## Proposal

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a TiDB user, create PD in ms mode.

#### Story 2

As a TiDB user, create TSO service and change PD from normal mode to ms mode.

### Risks and Mitigations

- There are too many component CRDs and all of them need a similar `overlay` field.
  - Extract a common CRD for `overlay` field which can be referred by all components.

## Design Details

### API

#### PD (API Service)

Reuse PDGroup/PD CRD for API Service of PD in ms mode. Just add a new `mode` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
kind: PDGroup
...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      mode: ms
```

#### TSO Service

```yaml
apiVersion: core.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
kind: TSOGroup
metadata:
  name: tso
spec:
  cluster:
    name: db
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        author: pingcap
    spec:
      resources:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: 8Gi
      config: |
        [log]
        level = "debug"
```

#### Scheduling Service

```yaml
apiVersion: core.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
kind: SchedulingGroup
metadata:
  name: scheduling
spec:
  cluster:
    name: db
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        author: pingcap
    spec:
      resources:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: 8Gi
      config: |
        [log]
        level = "debug"
```

#### Admission Control Service

```yaml
apiVersion: core.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
kind: AdmissionControllerGroup
metadata:
  name: admission
spec:
  cluster:
    name: db
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        author: pingcap
    spec:
      resources:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: 8Gi
      config: |
        [log]
        level = "debug"
```

### Operations

#### Update PD to ms mode

Steps are unordered. `PD/PDGroup` controllers will wait until `TSOGroup` is synced and ready.

- Change PD mode to ms
- Apply TSO
- (Optional) Apply scheduling svc
- (Optional) Apply admission control svc


#### Update PD back to normal mode

Steps are also unordered. `TSOGroup` will block deletion if PD mode is still `ms`.

- Change PD mode to normal
- (Optional) Del TSO
- (Optional) Del scheduling svc
- (Optional) Del admission control svc

#### Upgrade versions

TiDB Operator will automatically ensure the version skew policy of PDMS components. Now the default skew poligy is versions of all PDMS components are **not greater than** PD


#### Update PD Config

All components can update config at the same time. It all depends on the request order of clients.

### Test Plan

### Feature Gate

No feature gate

## Drawbacks

- Add too many components
- All PD components share many common fields

## Alternatives

### All PDMS components(TSO, scheduler, ...) in one CRD

Pros:
- Some fields can be shared.

Cons:
- Not flexiable.
- Cannot support `scale` subresource.
- Too complex and hard to display status of a specific component.
