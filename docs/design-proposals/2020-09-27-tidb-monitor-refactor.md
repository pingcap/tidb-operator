# TiDB Monitor Refactor

## Summary

This document presents a design to refactor tidb monitor,solve some problems in monitoring uniformly.

## Motivation

Currently, it is not friendly that tidbmonitor monitor multiple cluster under the same namespaces or different namespaces.In a multi-cluster TLS environment, the cert of tidbmonitor is bound to the first cluster of the cluster,we should eliminate this binding relationship.
Secondly,tidbmonitor is also a statefulset application,we should switch to statefulset deploy from deployment crd,this process should smooth upgrade.
Also, many users will integrate the companyâ€™s existing monitoring system, we should support thanos sidecar spec refer to the Prometheus operator, and optimize metric service and provide googe yaml example like `ServiceMonitor` ,`thanos` etc.
Others are some small optimization points,providing more field for `kubectl get tidbmonitor`  command, supporting multiple cluster grafana dashborad,optimizing pd dashboard address writing logic,fulling e2e and unit testing etc.

### Goals

* Make TidbMonitor able to monitor multiple TidbClusters at non-TLS environment.
* Improve the monitor's Unit and E2E test.
* Smooth upgrade deployment to statefulset.
* Support thanos sidecar and more friendly integration of Prometheus operator.

### Non-Goals


## Proposal


* Check tidbmonitor monitor multiple clusters cross multiple ns in tls and non-tls environments.
* Support multiple cluster grafana dashboard.
	
* Smooth upgrade deployment to statefulset.
* Support thanos spec and optimize thanos example.
* Optimze tidb service,more friendly support prometheus operator `ServiceMonitor`.
* Refactor for pd dashboard address writing.


* Fix combination of Kubernetes monitoring and TiDB cluster monitoring.
* Add more external field for  `kubectl get tm` command.


### Test Plan

* Deploy tidbmonitor monitor multiple clusters cross multiple ns in tls and non-tls environments.
* Deploy tidbmonitor monitor multiple clusters cross same ns in tls and non-tls environments.
* Deploy tidbmonitor monitor smoothly upgrade to statefulset.
* Deploy tidbmointor with thanos sidecar,checking thanos metric data.
* Use prometheus operator `ServiceMonitor` monitor tidb.

## Drawbacks

* Make monitoring easier to use.
