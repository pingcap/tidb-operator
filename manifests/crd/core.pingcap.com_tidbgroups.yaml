                      type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                      options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                      to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                      specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                      EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                      allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                      than a virtual IP.
                      "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.
                      "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                      Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                  The steps to enable this feature:
                                    1. Generate a TiDB server-side certificate and a client-side certifiacete for the TiDB cluster.
                                       There are multiple ways to generate certificates:
                                         - user-provided certificates: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/generate-self-signed-certificates
                                         - use the K8s built-in certificate signing system signed certificates: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/
                                         - or use cert-manager signed certificates: https://cert-manager.io/
                                    2. Create a K8s Secret object which contains the TiDB server-side certificate created above.
                                       The name of this Secret must be: <groupName>-tidb-server-secret.
                                         kubectl create secret generic <groupName>-tidb-server-secret --namespace=<namespace> --from-file=tls.crt=<path/to/tls.crt> --from-file=tls.key=<path/to/tls.key> --from-file=ca.crt=<path/to/ca.crt>
                                    3. Create a K8s Secret object which contains the TiDB client-side certificate created above which will be used by TiDB Operator.
                                       The name of this Secret must be: <groupName>-tidb-client-secret.
                                         kubectl create secret generic <groupName>-tidb-client-secret --namespace=<namespace> --from-file=tls.crt=<path/to/tls.crt> --from-file=tls.key=<path/to/tls.key> --from-file=ca.crt=<path/to/ca.crt>
                                    4. Set Enabled to `true`.
