                    calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and
                    the current value by the current number of pods.  Ergo, metrics
                    used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See

                    how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default
                    metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.
