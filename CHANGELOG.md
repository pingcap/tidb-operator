# TiDB Operator v1.0.6 Release Notes

## v1.0.6 What's New

Action required: Users should migrate the configs in `values.yaml` of previous chart releases to the new `values.yaml` of the new chart. Otherwise, the monitor pods might fail when you upgrade the monitor with the new chart.

For example, configs in the old `values.yaml` file:

```
monitor:
  ...
  initializer:
    image: pingcap/tidb-monitor-initializer:v3.0.5
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  ...
```

After migration, configs in the new `values.yaml` file should be as follows:

```
monitor:
  ...
  initializer:
    image: pingcap/tidb-monitor-initializer:v3.0.5
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    config:
      K8S_PROMETHEUS_URL: http://prometheus-k8s.monitoring.svc:9090
  ...
```

### Monitor

# TiDB Operator v1.0.5 Release Notes

## v1.0.5 What's New

There is no action required if you are upgrading from [v1.0.4](#tidb-operator-v104-release-notes).

### Scheduled Backup

- Fix the issue that backup failed when `clusterName` is too long ([#1229](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1229))

### TiDB Binlog

- It is recommended that TiDB and Pump be deployed on the same node through the `affinity` feature and Pump be dispersed on different nodes through the `anti-affinity` feature. At most only one Pump instance is allowed on each node. We added a guide to the chart. ([#1251](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1251))

### Compatibility

- Fix `tidb-scheduler` RBAC permission in Kubernetes v1.16 ([#1282](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1282))
- Do not set `DNSPolicy` if `hostNetwork` is disabled to keep backward compatibility ([#1287](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1287))

### E2E

- Fix e2e nil point dereference ([#1221](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1221))

# TiDB Operator v1.0.4 Release Notes

## v1.0.4 What's New

### Action Required

There is no action required if you are upgrading from [v1.0.3](#tidb-operator-v103-release-notes).

### Highlights

[#1202](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1202) introduced `HostNetwork` support, which offers better performance compared to the Pod network. Check out our [benchmark report](https://pingcap.com/docs/dev/benchmark/sysbench-in-k8s/#pod-network-vs-host-network) for details.

> **Note:**
>
> Due to [this issue of Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78420), the Kubernetes cluster must be one of the following versions to enable `HostNetwork` of the TiDB cluster:
>  - `v1.13.11` or later
>  - `v1.14.7` or later
>  - `v1.15.4` or later
>  - any version since `v1.16.0`

[#1175](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1175) added the `podSecurityContext` support for TiDB cluster Pods. We recommend setting the namespaced kernel parameters for TiDB cluster Pods according to our [Environment Recommendation](https://pingcap.com/docs/dev/tidb-in-kubernetes/deploy/prerequisites/#the-configuration-of-kernel-parameters).

New Helm chart `tidb-lightning` brings [TiDB Lightning](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/tools/tidb-lightning/overview/) support for TiDB in Kubernetes. Check out the [document](https://pingcap.com/docs/dev/tidb-in-kubernetes/maintain/lightning/) for detailed user guide.

Another new Helm chart `tidb-drainer` brings multiple drainers support for TiDB Binlog in Kubernetes. Check out the [document](https://pingcap.com/docs/dev/tidb-in-kubernetes/maintain/tidb-binlog/#deploy-multiple-drainers) for detailed user guide.

### Improvements

- Support HostNetwork ([#1202](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1202))
- Support configuring sysctls for Pods and enable net.* ([#1175](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1175))
- Add tidb-lightning support ([#1161](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1161))
- Add new helm chart tidb-drainer to support multiple drainers ([#1160](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1160))

## Detailed Bug Fixes and Changes

- Add e2e scripts and simplify the e2e Jenkins file ([#1174](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1174))
- Fix the pump/drainer data directory to avoid data loss caused by bad configuration ([#1183](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1183))
- Add init sql case to e2e ([#1199](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1199))
- Keep the instance label of drainer same with the TiDB cluster in favor of monitoring ([#1170](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1170))
- Set `podSecuriyContext` to nil by default in favor of backward compatibility ([#1184](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1184))

## Additional Notes for Users of v1.1.0.alpha branch

For historical reasons, `v1.1.0.alpha` is a hot-fix branch and got this name by mistake. All fixes in that branch are cherry-picked to `v1.0.4` and the `v1.1.0.alpha` branch will be discarded to keep things clear.

We strongly recommend you to upgrade to `v1.0.4` if you are using any version under `v1.1.0.alpha`.

`v1.0.4` introduces the following fixes comparing to `v1.1.0.alpha.3`:

- Support HostNetwork ([#1202](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1202))
- Add the permit host option for tidb-initializer job ([#779](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/779))
- Fix drainer misconfiguration in tidb-cluster chart ([#945](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/945))
- Set the default `externalTrafficPolicy` to be Local for TiDB services ([#960](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/960))
- Fix tidb-operator crash when users modify sts upgrade strategy improperly ([#969](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/969))
- Add the `maxFailoverCount` limit to TiKV ([#976](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/976))
- Fix values file customization for tidb-operator on aliyun ([#983](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/983))
- Do not limit failover count when maxFailoverCount = 0 ([#978](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/978))
- Suspend the `ReplaceUnhealthy` process for TiKV auto-scaling-group on AWS ([#1027](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1027))
- Fix the issue that the `create_tidb_cluster_release` variable does not work ([#1066](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1066)))
- Add `v1` to statefulset apiVersions ([#1056](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1056))
- Add timezone support ([#1126](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1027))

# TiDB Operator v1.0.3 Release Notes

## v1.0.3 What's New

### Action Required

ACTION REQUIRED: This release upgrades default TiDB version to `v3.0.5` which fixed a serious [bug](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12597) in TiDB. So if you are using TiDB `v3.0.4` or prior versions, you **must** upgrade to `v3.0.5`.

ACTION REQUIRED: This release adds the `timezone` support for [all charts](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/tree/master/charts).

For existing TiDB clusters. If the `timezone` in `tidb-cluster/values.yaml` has been customized to other timezones instead of the default `UTC`, then upgrading tidb-operator will trigger a rolling update for the related pods.

The related pods include `pump`, `drainer`, `discovery`, `monitor`, `scheduled backup`, `tidb-initializer`, and `tikv-importer`.

The time zone for all images maintained by `tidb-operator` should be `UTC`. If you use your own images, you need to make sure that the corresponding time zones are `UTC`.

### Improvements

- Add the `timezone` support for all containers of the TiDB cluster
- Support configuring resource requests and limits for all containers of the TiDB cluster

## Detailed Bug Fixes and Changes

- Upgrade default TiDB version to `v3.0.5` ([#1132](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1132))
- Add the `timezone` support for all containers of the TiDB cluster ([#1122](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/1122))
- Support configuring resource requests and limits for all containers of the TiDB cluster ([#853](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/853))

# TiDB Operator v1.0.2 Release Notes

## v1.0.2 What's New

### Action Required

The AWS Terraform script uses auto-scaling-group for all components (PD/TiKV/TiDB/monitor). When an ec2 instance fails the health check, the instance will be replaced. This is helpful for those applications that are stateless or use EBS volumes to store data.

But a TiKV Pod uses instance store to store its data. When an instance is replaced, all the data on its store will be lost. TiKV has to resync all data to the newly added instance. Though TiDB is a distributed database and can work when a node fails, resyncing data can cost much if the dataset is large. Besides, the ec2 instance may be recovered to a healthy state by rebooting.

So we disabled the auto-scaling-group's replacing behavior in `v1.0.2`.

Auto-scaling-group scaling process can also be suspended according to its [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html) if you are using `v1.0.1` or prior versions.

### Improvements

- Suspend ReplaceUnhealthy process for AWS TiKV auto-scaling-group
- Add a new VM manager `qm` in stability test
- Add `tikv.maxFailoverCount` limit to TiKV
- Set the default `externalTrafficPolicy` to be `Local` for TiDB service in AWS/GCP/Aliyun
- Add provider and module versions for AWS

### Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that tkctl version does not work when the release name is un-wanted
- Migrate statefulsets apiVersion to `app/v1` which fixes compatibility with Kubernetes 1.16 and above versions
- Fix the issue that the `create_tidb_cluster_release` variable in AWS Terraform script does not work
- Fix compatibility issues by adding `v1beta1` to statefulset apiVersions
- Fix the issue that TiDB Loadbalancer is empty in Terraform output
- Fix a compatibility issue of TiKV `maxFailoverCount`
- Fix Terraform providers version constraint issues for GCP and Aliyun
- Fix values file customization for tidb-operator on Aliyun
- Fix tidb-operator crash when users modify statefulset upgrade strategy improperly
- Fix drainer misconfiguration

# TiDB Operator v1.0.1 Release Notes

## v1.0.1 What's New

### Action Required

- ACTION REQUIRED: We fixed a serious bug ([#878](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/878)) that could cause all `PD` and `TiKV` pods to be accidentally deleted when `kube-apiserver` fails. This would cause TiDB service outage. So if you are using `v1.0.0` or prior versions, you **must** upgrade to `v1.0.1`.
- ACTION REQUIRED: The backup tool image [pingcap/tidb-cloud-backup](https://hub.docker.com/r/pingcap/tidb-cloud-backup) uses a forked version of [`Mydumper`](https://github.com/pingcap/mydumper). The current version `pingcap/tidb-cloud-backup:20190610` contains a serious bug that could result in a missing column in the exported data. This is fixed in [#29](https://github.com/pingcap/mydumper/pull/29). And the default image used now contains this fixed version. So if you are using the old version image for backup, you **must** upgrade to use `pingcap/tidb-cloud-backup:201908028` and do a new full backup to avoid potential data inconsistency.

### Improvements

- Modularize GCP Terraform
