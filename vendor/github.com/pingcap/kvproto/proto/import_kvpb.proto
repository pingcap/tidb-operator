// ImportKV provides a service to import key-value pairs to TiKV.
//
// In order to import key-value pairs to TiKV, the user should:
// 1. Open an engine identified by an UUID.
// 2. Open write streams to write key-value batch to the opened engine.
//    Different streams/clients can write to the same engine concurrently.
// 3. Close the engine after all write batches are finished. An engine can only
//    be closed when all write streams are closed. An engine can only be closed
//    once, and it can not be opened again once it is closed.
