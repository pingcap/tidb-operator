# TiDB Operator

[![Build Status](https://internal.pingcap.net/jenkins/job/build_tidb_operator_master/badge/icon)](https://internal.pingcap.net/jenkins/job/build_tidb_operator_master)

TiDB Operator manages [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and automates tasks related to operating a TiDB cluster. It makes TiDB a truly cloud-native database.

> **Warning:** Currently, TiDB Operator is work in progress [WIP] and is NOT ready for production. Use at your own risk.

## Features

    Users can deploy and manage multiple TiDB clusters on a single Kubernetes cluster easily.

- __Automatic failover__ (WIP)

    TiDB Operator automatically performs failover for your TiDB cluster when node failures occur.

- __Kubernetes package manager support__

    By embracing Kubernetes package manager [Helm](https://helm.sh), users can easily deploy TiDB clusters with only one command.

- __Automatically monitoring TiDB cluster at creating__

    Automatically deploy Prometheus, Grafana for TiDB cluster monitoring.
