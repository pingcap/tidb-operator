# Whether enable the TLS connection between TiDB server components
tlsCluster:
  # The steps to enable this feature:
  #   1. Generate Drainer certificate.
  #      There are multiple ways to generate these certificates:
  #        - user-provided certificates: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/how-to/secure/generate-self-signed-certificates/
  #        - use the K8s built-in certificate signing system signed certificates: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/
  #        - or use cert-manager signed certificates: https://cert-manager.io/
  #   2. Create one secret object for Drainer which contains the certificates created above.
  #      The name of this Secret must be: <clusterName>-drainer-cluster-secret.
  #        For Drainer: kubectl create secret generic <clusterName>-drainer-cluster-secret --namespace=<namespace> --from-file=tls.crt=<path/to/tls.crt> --from-file=tls.key=<path/to/tls.key> --from-file=ca.crt=<path/to/ca.crt>
  #   3. Then create the Drainer cluster with `tlsCluster.enabled` set to `true`.

# The TLS config between drainer and the downstream database server (MySQL/TiDB)
tlsSyncer: {}
  # The steps to enable this feature:
  #   1. Generate MySQL Client certificate.
  #      There are documents help to generate these certificates:
  #        - enable TLS for the MySQL Client through cfssl or cert-manager: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/enable-tls-for-mysql-client
  #        - check and enble TLS for the MySQL Client: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/enable-tls-between-clients-and-servers
  #   2. Create one secret object for Drainer which contains the certificates created above.
  #      Suggest the name of this Secret is <downstream_database_secret_name>.
  #        For Drainer: kubectl create secret generic ${downstream_database_secret_name} --namespace=${namespace} --from-file=tls.crt=client.pem --from-file=tls.key=client-key.pem --from-file=ca.crt=ca.pem
  #   3. Then create the Drainer cluster with `tlsSyncer.tlsClientSecretName` set to `<downstream_database_secret_name>`.
  # tlsClientSecretName: demo-tidb-client-secret

  # certAllowedCN is the Common Name that allowed
  # certAllowedCN: []
  #  - TiDB

  # checkpoint is the TLS config for the database we save binlog checkpoint
  # In most cases, you needn't to specify [syncer.to.checkpoint.type].
  # Drainer will use downstream to save binlog checkpoint and you can just left this field commented.
  # You have to fill this field only if you want to save binlog checkpoint to ** another database which has enabled TLS **.
  # The steps to enable this feature is similar like enable tlsSyncer.tlsClientSecretName,
  # which means you need to Generate MySQL Client certificate, create one secret object and then set tlsClientSecretName
  # to your checkpoint database secret name like above.
  # checkpoint: {}
  # tlsClientSecretName: checkpoint-tidb-client-secret
  # certAllowedCN is the Common Name that allowed

# Refer to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/blob/master/cmd/drainer/drainer.toml
# [security] section will be generated automatically if tlsCluster.enabled is set to true so users do not need to configure it.
