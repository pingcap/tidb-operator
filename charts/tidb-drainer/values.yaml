# Whether enable the TLS connection between TiDB server components
tlsCluster:
  # The steps to enable this feature:
  #   1. Generate Drainer certificate.
  #      There are multiple ways to generate these certificates:
  #        - user-provided certificates: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/how-to/secure/generate-self-signed-certificates/
  #        - use the K8s built-in certificate signing system signed certificates: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/
  #        - or use cert-manager signed certificates: https://cert-manager.io/
  #   2. Create one secret object for Drainer which contains the certificates created above.
  #      The name of this Secret must be: <clusterName>-drainer-cluster-secret.
  #        For Drainer: kubectl create secret generic <clusterName>-drainer-cluster-secret --namespace=<namespace> --from-file=tls.crt=<path/to/tls.crt> --from-file=tls.key=<path/to/tls.key> --from-file=ca.crt=<path/to/ca.crt>
  #   3. Then create the Drainer cluster with `tlsCluster.enabled` set to `true`.
  enabled: false

  # certAllowedCN is the Common Name that allowed
  certAllowedCN: []
  #  - TiDB

# Refer to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/blob/master/cmd/drainer/drainer.toml
# [security] section will be generated automatically if tlsCluster.enabled is set to true so users do not need to configure it.
