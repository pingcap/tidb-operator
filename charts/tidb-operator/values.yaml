#     Enable stable scheduling of tidb servers.
#
#   AdvancedStatefulSet (default: false)
#     If enabled, tidb-operator will use AdvancedStatefulSet to manage pods
#     instead of Kubernetes StatefulSet.
#     It's ok to turn it on if this feature is not enabled. However it's not ok
#     to turn it off when the tidb-operator already uses AdvancedStatefulSet to
#     manage pods. This is in alpha phase.
