# Enable or disable tidb-operator features:
#
#   AdvancedStatefulSet (default: false)
#     If enabled, tidb-operator will use AdvancedStatefulSet to manage pods
#     instead of Kubernetes StatefulSet.
#     It's ok to turn it on if this feature is not enabled. However it's not ok
#     to turn it off when the tidb-operator already uses AdvancedStatefulSet to
#     manage pods. This is in GA phase.
#     Ref: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/advanced-statefulset
#
#   VolumeModifying (default false)
#     If enabled, tidb-operator support to increase the size or performance of volumes
#     for specific volume provisioner. This is in GA phase for AWS EBS.
#
#   VolumeReplacing (default false)
#     If enabled, tidb-operator support generic volume changes (size, storageclass & number of volumes)
#     by deleting old pod + pvc completely and replacing with new pods/PVCs.
#     pd, tikv, tidb supported. If enabled, takes precedence over volume resizing & modifying.
#     This works by deleting pod+volumes one at a time (similar to scale-in), and recreating it.
#     For PD & TiKV this will first create one new spare replica to take the load before deleting existing ones
#     Safely deleting a volume and replacing them can take a long time (Especially TiKV to move regions).
#     This is in Alpha phase.
